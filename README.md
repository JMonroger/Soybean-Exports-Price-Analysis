# Soybean-Exports-Price-Analysis

# Objective
Analyze the relationship between soybean futures prices and Chinese import demand, using US weekly soybean exports to China as a proxy.

# Data Description
- Weekly US soybean exports to China (USDA data), used as a proxy for Chinese import demand  
- Soybean futures closing prices (CBOT)

# Methodology
- Data cleaning and alignment of export volumes and futures prices
- Aggregation of weekly data
- Statistical analysis and visualization of the relationship between export flows and futures prices
- Correlation analysis using Python

# Results
The analysis shows a limited correlation between US soybean exports to China and soybean futures closing prices.

# Interpretation
The absence of strong correlation suggests that Chinese import demand is largely anticipated by market participants and already incorporated into futures prices.  
Weekly export data is often lagged and reflects realized flows rather than market expectations, which are the primary drivers of price formation.

# Conclusion
Soybean futures prices appear to be driven more by expectations, forward-looking information and broader market factors than by published weekly export figures alone.

# Tools
Python, pandas, matplotlib
